# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
  I learned how to use the terminal to create a new React app with Vite. It was done using the terminal. I used Webstorm to modify the .jsx files.
- How to write and structure a functional React component
  I practiced writing a basic functional component using JavaScript. I learned that you need to use a couple .jsx files. The rest of the files are created automatically.
- How to use JSX and inline styles
  I learned how to mix HTML-like code with JavaScript using JSX. I also used inline CSS to quickly style elements without making a separate CSS file.
- How to render a component in App.jsx
  I figured out how to import a picture and display it inside App.jsx. It was cool to see my picture appear on the homepage. It looked good right away.

## Challenges
At first, the text color wasn’t showing up right because the default global styles were making everything white. I fixed it by overriding the styles with my own and adjusting the root CSS settings. I also had some trouble pushing to GitHub but solved it by updating my credentials and using a personal access token.

## Screenshot
Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
